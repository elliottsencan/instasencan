# Instatest
Instatest is a simple application that displays a slideshow of Instagram images filtered by a single tag entered by the user. It works, but not well.  There are a few bugs and usability issues, and the code is very difficult to read and nearly impossible to test.

## Setup
1. Clone the instatest repository. 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Make sure you have Node and npm installed, then run ``npm install``.  
4. Run ``gulp``.
4. Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://localhost.com:3000](http://localhost.com:3000).

## Instructions for completing the exercise

1. Fix all the bugs you can find.
2. Refactor the code for greater readability and testability.
4. Commit your changes as often as you normally would, using your preferred message format. 
5. Follow your usual workflow. Feel free to branch, merge, rebase, etc., as you see fit.
6. Make sure the code works as intended and is free of defects.
5. When done, push your changes to origin/master.
